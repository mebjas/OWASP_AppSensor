Tasks Accomplished: 
1. Installed scikit-learn version 0.18.2
2. Found sample Apache web server logs here:
   https://www.honeynet.org/node/456
   http://log-sharing.dreamhosters.com
   Description: The site contains various free shareable log samples from various systems, security and network devices,
   applications, etc. The logs are collected from real systems, some contain evidence of compromise 
   and other malicious activity. Wherever possible, the logs are NOT sanitized, anonymized or modified in any 
   way (just as they came from the logging system)
   License / permission to use: public; use for whatever you want.
   
   Downloaded and extracted a few Apache Access logs from the tar.gz files found here.
   
3. For data creation/mocking capability:
   Found 'Faker', a Python library for generating fake apache web logs. 
   https://github.com/kiritbasu/Fake-Apache-Log-Generator
   Installed the requirements required for Faker using pip install:
   fake-factory==0.7.2
    numpy==1.11.2
    Faker==0.7.3
    pytz==2016.7
    tzlocal==1.3.0
    All except for 'Faker' got installed. While executing 'pip install Faker', I'm currently getting an error 
    with respect to its dependency 'python-dateutil'. It requires version >= 2.4. Version 1.5 is already installed.
    I'm not being able to uninstall it even after running it with root/sudo privilege.
    
    "Installing collected packages: python-dateutil, Faker
    Found existing installation: python-dateutil 1.5
    Uninstalling python-dateutil-1.5:"
    "[Errno 1] Operation not permitted:/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/dateutil/*"
    
    Once this gets running, it is possible to generate logs after running the python script:
    python apache-fake-log-gen.py -n 100 -o LOG (this generates 100 log lines to a file)
    
   
  4. For the invalid authentication example, the status that the server would be returning is '401' for 
     invalid authentication. Found a couple of example sample logs.

     Here, the same client is making requests which are being denied due to invalid credentials over a period of 3 minutes.

     Tasks to be completed:
     1. Run scikit-learn algorithm on the above sample data for invalid auth by converting it to JSON first and using features
        accordingly.
     2. Get the Faker running so that we have mocking capability ready. (Blocked due to the error mentioned above currently).
